## Feedback
This was quite a fun project to work on. This was my first project with NextJS (having worked some with React and Gatsby, it wasn't too crazy to move through. I spent a good portion of time playing and navigating through the folders and files. I also spent a lot of time going through the documentation. This project was a neat way to mess around with props, state, and flexbox. I had some trouble wrapping my head around when/where to use "getServerSideProps" or "getStaticProps". I couldn't help but dig into what this would require to include dynamic routes, which looks a bit tricky, but like it could be fun to work through and figure out. If I had more time and were to do it again, I would probably use more Material UI and possibly implement Tailwind CSS. For organizational purposes I would also look more into how to better organize the CSS for each page/component. I appreciated the direction, instructions, and wireframe. It was very easy to read and understand what was expected. Overall, I thought this was a great mock project and it got me excited to continue learning and practicing NextJS.
